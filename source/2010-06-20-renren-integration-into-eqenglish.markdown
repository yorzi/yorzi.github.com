Thus, Renren is widely considered to be the most powerful SNS service in Mainland China, especially among college students.

And, <a href="http://www.eqenglish.com">EQEnglish</a> is the fastest growing 1:1 English training service powered by <a href="http://www.idapted.com" target="_blank">Idapted</a> in China. It's delivering thousands of lessons a week to students all over China with its professional foreign teachers. Now, conveniently, all Renren's users can login EQenglish directly without registration again, at the same time, EQenglish is also using Renren site's platform <a href="http://wiki.dev.renren.com/wiki/API" target="_blank">API</a> to share learners' study status with the community.

To login EQenglish via Renren account, you need to, at least have one Renren account, then on EQenglish portal you will see a login form  as right after you click "Connect via Rreren". After you input your user name and password EQenglish will present you a guide page on which you decide to bundle your exist EQ account with your Renren account or just every time use your Renren account login EQ platform.

What will happen next when you do the login?

On EQenglish website, you will be marked with a Renren icon and you can share EQ learning materials or EQ discussion thread or EQ study status with your Renren friends. For instance, you just discussed an EQ lesson named "EQ IELTS Formula 26: Evaluating Two Different Opinions" with your classmates on EQenglish studycenter, then the system will send this discussion status to your Renren friends, something like "Hey, I am discussing an interesting EQ lesson on their website, come and join in, it's cool..", surely, it's based on your Renren setting on connected websites.

There, on Renren website, is also an <a href="http://page.renren.com/699099142/index" target="_blank">application home page</a> where all the EQ followers can keep talking about their EQ study story or learning experience, At the same time, EQ consultants spread out EQ learning tips with all its fans. In past two weeks, there are more than 300 learners follow EQ application in Renren Site. People rate <a href="http://page.renren.com/699099142/reviews" target="_blank">many 5-stars</a> for this connection application.

So, users conveniently use their Renren accounts to login EQenglish. The user may then grant EQenglish access to their public data including: Real identity information, social graph, etc. Using this information, EQenglish can expand leaner base and strengthen the social aspects of EQ self. What's useful is, Renren users can find all the valuable information on EQenglish message feeds through their friends feeds, People can make content(EQ learning materials), or anything else(lesson discussion thread) available for sharing.

Technically, this integration is still have big room to improve, it depends on Renren's open platform, We are ready to enhance user experience for all EQenglish learners, We always believe in a formula when we development EQenglish learning system, that is:
Great Technology + Clear Convenience = Comfortable Awesome
