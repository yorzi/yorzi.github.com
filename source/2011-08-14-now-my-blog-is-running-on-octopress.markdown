Octopress is owesome!

Last time I tried to migrate my wordpress blog to [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), then I failed to find some beautiful theme. And when [intridea cn blog](cn.intridea.com) was built using [nanoc](https://github.com/ddfreyne/nanoc), I'd like to give it try, you know, I still gave nanoc up as I can not make the theme pretty by myself.

Days ago, I came across the [octopress](http://www.octopress.org), I totally fell in love with its convenience and cool blog theme. I spent several hours to move my blog to github this afternoon. Oh my, Now I can write blogs in Markdown and deploy it to github.

Octopress has its official website with many valuable materials to help you get start and doing other regarding interesting things. Cool, hah? Try it out now!
