<span style="color:rgb(192, 192, 192)">Faye Wong</span><br />
<br />
Whenever sang my songs<br />
On the stage, on my own<br />
Whenever said my words<br />
Wishing they would be heard<br />
I saw you smiling at me<br />
Was it real or just my fantasy<br />
You'd always be there in the corner<br />
Of this tiny little bar<br />
<br />
My last night here for you<br />
Same old songs, just once more<br />
My last night here with you?<br />
Maybe yes, maybe no<br />
I kind of liked it your way<br />
How you shyly placed your eyes on me<br />
Oh, did you ever know?<br />
That I had mine on you<br />
<br />
Darling, so there you are<br />
With that look on your face<br />
As if you're never hurt<br />
As if you're never down<br />
Shall I be the one for you<br />
Who pinches you softly but sure<br />
If frown is shown then<br />
I will know that you are no dreamer<br />
<br />
So let me come to you<br />
Close as I wanted to be<br />
Close enough for me<br />
To feel your heart beating fast<br />
And stay there as I whisper<br />
How I loved your peaceful eyes on me<br />
Did you ever know<br />
That I had mine on you<br />
<br />
Darling, so share with me<br />
Your love if you have enough<br />
Your tears if you're holding back<br />
Or pain if that's what it is<br />
How can I let you know<br />
I'm more than the dress and the voice<br />
Just reach me out then<br />
You will know that you're not dreaming<br />
</div></p>
