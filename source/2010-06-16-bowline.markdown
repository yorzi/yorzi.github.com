<p><blockquote>Bowline is a framework for making cross platform desktop applications in Ruby, HTML and JavaScript.</blockquote></p>

<p>If you've ever wished creating a desktop application was as simple as creating a Rails website, Bowline's for you.</p>

<p>Bowline respects MVC, you can design your views in HTML5/CSS3 - then bind them to your Ruby models. There's no request/response cycle - any changes in models automatically get reflected in the view.
<p style="text-align: right;"><strong>See : <a href="http://bowlineapp.com/">http://bowlineapp.com/</a></strong></p>
Experiment on this framework:</p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<p>* Mac OSX &gt;=10.5 or Ubuntu -----&gt; [I am on Ubuntu 9.04]<br />
* Ruby 1.9 -----------------------------&gt; [I use <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/">RVM</a> to switch ruby between different version]<br />
* Bowline gem -----------------------&gt; sudo gem install <a href="http://github.com/maccman/bowline">bowline</a></p>

<p><strong>RVM</strong></p>

<p>* <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/">Install RVM</a> to manage Ruby easily, then you decide which version you will use.</p>

<p>OK, Now create an application in an easy way:
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>&gt;&gt; bowline-gen app helloworld<br />
&gt;&gt; cd helloworld<br />
&gt;&gt; bowline-bundle<br />
&gt;&gt; ./script/run</em></span></p>

<p>Unluckily, On Ubuntu 9.0.4, There is an error about a needed lib when I run the application, see
<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>/usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.11' not found (required by /home/andy/.bowline/bowline-desktop)</em></span></p>

<p>I searched around and found it's something wrong with gcc version, or these is still a webkit lib involved issue under Ubuntu9.0.4, anyway, it's interesting to me, I am now wondering if we can reference some bowline experience to create iphone/ipad application based on ruby on rails. not sure, I am researching in advance.</p>
