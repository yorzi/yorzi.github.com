I found a cool gem called "cheat", it's pretty handy and convenient when you wanna see a brief help/introduction of some "stuff" in command line, cheat out the website for more <a href="http://cheat.errtheblog.com/b">wiki-versioned cheat sheet</a>.

<blockquote>
Get started:
<i style="color:yellow">$ sudo gem install cheat
$ cheat strftime</i>

A magnificent cheat sheet for Ruby's strftime method will be printed to your terminal.

To get some help on cheat itself:
<i style="color:yellow">$ cheat cheat</i>

How meta.

Cheat sheets are basically wiki pages accessible from the command line. You can browse, add, or edit cheat sheets. Try to keep them concise. For a style guide, check out the cheat cheat sheet.

To access a cheat sheet, simply pass the program the desired sheet's name:
<i style="color:yellow">$ cheat <sheet name></i>
