In last two month, I worked with our designer(<a href="http://www.lijiapeng.com">buzz</a>) for Idapted first iPhone App. We spent a lot time on releasing this app as Apple's process is really awful to a first user. Well, everything was done in the last. Now our first iPhone App is available in Apple Store. It's free in current version. you can install it from here: <a href="http://goo.gl/ht4p">http://goo.gl/ht4p</a>. It's based on <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/">Titanium 1.4</a>. so a big thanks to the brilliant <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/company/leadership-team/">Appcelerator Team</a>.

We open sourced this app on our <a href="http://github.com/idapted/eq31formulas">github repos</a>. We also built a website for this app at <a href="http://www.31formulas.com">http://www.31formulas.com</a>

Enjoy it and let us know if you have any feedback on it.
