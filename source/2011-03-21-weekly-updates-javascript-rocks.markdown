After quit from Idapted/Eleutian, I'd like to have a long term plan for writing blogs. However, as everything starts, it's always hard. I thought it around, and finally decided to open my mind, and just try to start with a strong belief : Sharing! Then an idea comes out.  

First of all, I think my weekly updates will help to share great things I came across or even I started to use, it has much fun to replay all these stuff, so I will do that in the weekend, that's also part of my study review.

Ok, turn to the points:

1. Now you must know <a href="http://www.javascriptlint.com/index.htm">JSLint</a>. JSlint is a Javascript checker, which can help you ensure your JS' quality. There are many great open source projects helping you to program in Javascript.

Sources:
Github Proj: <a href="https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint">https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSLint</a>
Add JSLint to you TextMate: <a href="https://github.com/subtleGradient/javascript-tools.tmbundle">https://github.com/subtleGradient/javascript-tools.tmbundle</a>

2. Are you familiar with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development">BDD</a>? You should start to learn it now if you did not have a change to give it a try. Specially, if you are using Ruby/Ruby on Rails, I strongly recommend you try <a href="http://rspec.info/">rSpec</a> for the BDD. Back to the topic, I wanna share with you some similar BDD way in programming Javascript, <a href="https://github.com/visionmedia/jspec">jspec</a> and <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>, obviously, they are cool. I just mention this as a reminder people who want to try interesting programming. I didn't try them yet, but I guess I will do that in soon.

3. JS in real-time application <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Flotype/now">NowJS</a> 

4. Books to speed you up!

Javascript is a long journey, I am just on the start point. Anyway, exciting!
