<p>Have you ever seen a one trick pony in the field so happy and free<br />
If you've ever seen a one trick pony then you've seen me<br />
Have you ever seen a one legged dog makin' his way down the street<br />
If you've ever seen a one legged dog then you've seen me</p>

<p>(Then you've seen me) I come and stand at every door<br />
(Then you've seen me) I always leave with less than I had before<br />
(Then you've seen me) bet I can make you smile when the blood it hits the floor<br />
Tell me friend can you ask for anything more<br />
Tell me can you ask for anything more</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a scarecrow filled with nothing but dust and weeds<br />
If you've ever seen that scarecrow then you've seen me<br />
Have you ever seen a one armed man punchin' at nothing but the breeze<br />
If you've ever seen a one armed man then you've seen me</p>

<p>(Then you've seen me) I come and stand at every door<br />
(Then you've seen me) I always leave with less than I had before<br />
(Then you've seen me) bet I can make you smile when the blood it hits the floor<br />
Tell me friend can you ask for anything more<br />
Tell me can you ask for anything more</p>

<p>These things that have comforted me I drive away (anything more)<br />
This place that is my home I cannot stay (anything more)<br />
My only faith is in the broken bones and bruises I display</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a one legged man tryin' to dance his way free<br />
If you've ever seen a one legged man then you've seen me</p>

<p>[<em>PS, Thanks to the provider, LOVE this song very much</em>] </p>
