Last weekend, <a href="http://www.dujinfang.com">seven</a> and <a href="http://blog.sonitech.org/">sonic</a> did a great job to move all Idapted servers to a new datacenter, that's really a fabulous movement. Seven just wrote it out on <a href="http://www.dujinfang.com/past/2011/1/18/rails-fu-wu-qi-qian-yi-dian-di/">his blog</a>, if you want to know more about this migration, please go through his post. Anyway, in this post I wanna share a simple but valuable tip about deploying Rails3 app in sub directory.
