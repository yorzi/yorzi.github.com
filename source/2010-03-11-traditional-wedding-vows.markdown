<p><em> I, [Groom's name], take you [Bride's name], to be my wife, my partner in life and my one true love.<br />
I will cherish our friendship and love you today, tomorrow, and forever.<br />
I will trust you and honor you<br />
I will laugh with you and cry with you.<br />
I will love you faithfully<br />
Through the best and the worst,<br />
Through the difficult and the easy.<br />
What may come I will always be there.<br />
As I have given you my hand to hold<br />
So I give you my life to keep<br />
So help me God</em></p>

<p><em> I, [Bride's name], take you [Groom's name], to be my husband, my partner in life and my one true love.<br />
I will cherish our friendship and love you today,<br />
tomorrow, and forever<br />
I will trust you and honor you<br />
I will laugh with you and cry with you.<br />
I will love you faithfully<br />
Through the best and the worst,<br />
Through the difficult and the easy.<br />
What may come I will always be there.<br />
As I have given you my hand to hold<br />
So I give you my life to keep<br />
So help me God</em></p>

<p><em> Entreat me not to leave you, or to return from following after you,<br />
For where you go I will go,<br />
and where you stay I will stay<br />
Your people will be my people,<br />
and your God will be my God.<br />
And where you die, I will die and there I will be buried.<br />
May the Lord do with me and more if anything but death parts you from me.</em></p>
