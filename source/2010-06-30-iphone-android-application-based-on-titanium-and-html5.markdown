After a two-day experiment on <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/">Titanium framework</a> and HTML5 technology, I finally found, we can quickly move into iPhone/iPad application development if we have enough extra time to refactor our Rails core application into HTML5 version.

I've made a Titanium based app demo to show how to structure the application according to our current system. Titanium framework includes plenty of powerful <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/doc/kitchensink">APIs</a> for us to generate cool "application container", then we embed our content/system into this container. I think the Titanium can be organized clearly if we have clearly structured Rails/HTML5 application.

Talking about HTML5, I just want to share with everyone the resources I found, Google just started a HTML5 support website named <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/">html5rocks</a>, it has a <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/resources.html">html5 resources page</a> where it includes almost every single HTML5 resource website I found in last two days. (html5rocks was born blocked..)

PS, originally I want to show how I made a Titanium based iPhone application, but I found appcelerator really does a great job to help people getting started with Titanium, so I just quote it as below:
<blockquote>Titanium translates your hard won web skills into native applications that perform and look just like they were written in Objective-C [iPhone and iPad] or Java [Android]. With over 300 APIs, a thriving developer community, and the support you need, you can build applications that are more social, local, media rich, interactive, and extensible. <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/doc/mobile/get_started">Getting Started with Titanium Mobile</a>. All these information is clear and in detailed. Appcelerator does a great job to guide you to start.</blockquote>
