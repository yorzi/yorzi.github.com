<p><blockquote>Dear Colleagues,</blockquote></p>

<p>I am so sorry to tell that our deployment of new extra content is really not going well this afternoon, so that the whole Study Center is broken somehow, as it's been unluckily facing some unexpected errors while deploying such new features on product environment. Now <a href="http://www.dujinfang.com">seven</a>, gary and me are working on it, please wait for its being resolved..</p>

<p>Sorry for the inconvenience!</p>

<p>Today afternoon, I was upset when the deployment encountering issues. I thought I had been preparing carefully during last few days, but errors still came out. I summarize this lesson as following:</p>

<p>1.  Keep code as well as the deployment revertible.<br />
    I fall into a situation when I can not go forward and can not go backward. it's pretty bad case which makes me feel nervous somehow. unless, I can revert what I did, yeah, it's absolutely important.</p>

<p>2.  List out the steps before going through.<br />
    If we list all the regarding steps out one by one before we going through, I think at least we won't face the same bug we face many times while testing.</p>

<p>3. God helps one who owns good habits.<br />
   To be calm down and confident about solving problems. trying first before asking.</p>

<p>Finally, JP says his famous sentence : "It happens! and we learned."</p>
