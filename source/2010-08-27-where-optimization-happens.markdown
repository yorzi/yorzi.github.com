Jonathan just mentionedÂ <a href="http://www.idapted.com/blog/2010/08/16/small-details-big-gains/" target="_blank">small details and big gains</a> in his post days ago, I totally agree with him from technology perspective, meanwhile, I found more samples to support his points. Yeah, technology is born for changing people's life, I call this kind of changes as Optimization.Optimization is happening everyday to Idapted Platform, as it's one of most important way to become perfect.

In last week, our StudyCenter, the front end user interface system, was optimized in its registration flow. Previously, we have many registration channels for different partners. Our marketing department is mainly responsible for these registration channels, and update them frequently. Accordingly, technology team and sales team also need to cooperate. Here problem is, demands change more quickly than tech guys and sales system can follow up.

Now we refactor the control of registration flow, to re-think every departments' needs, we split the conditions for each department, after this improvement, people in different departments will not affect others, specially to tech guys, this is more flexible and maintainable. They will not messy all the situations up.

Another sample of optimization is that, we iterated many rounds of development to build a CRM system internally before, however, we integrated too many features inside the CRM, which were used by different departments. Because Idapted customers' accounts are increasing rapidly, the speed of whole system is getting slower and slower. Obviously, the CRM system needs optimization.

We finally split the CRM system in three parts which are used by different people, The independent and small system is well designed for certain users, that's the key of this Optimization. It gains us faster system response and clearer business devision.

All in all, to serve learners better user experience, to improve internal working process or to increase system efficiency, all of these optimizations are about making things perfect. This is the belief of <a href="http://www.idapted.com">Idapted</a>.
